This is a simple scrabble game made by implemented features in JQUERY such as drag and drop. Users are able to submit valid words which is checked 
against dictionary.txt and will have an error message pop up prompting for a new submission. There is also a reset option which allows users to keep playing but keeps the score from the previous round.
